            <p>This is a site where I talk about how to crack software.</p>
<p>As I don't have too much patience, most of the software I successfully crack comes from small companies or individuals.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will try not to reveal what software is being cracked in each post since I don't want to hurt small or boutique software developers. </p>
<p>These posts are just meant to highlight some techniques I use and to teach people how to bypass software restrictions. It's up to you to decide when cracking is ethical.</p>
<p>That being said, I may inadvertently reveal which piece of software is featured and for the reason described above, I'd ask you not to use the information from the article to crack said software.</p>
<p>Or more accurately, you can crack it, but just pay the developers too.</p>

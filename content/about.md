This is a site where I talk about how to crack software.

As I don't have too much patience, most of the software I successfully crack comes from small companies or individuals.

Therefore, I will try not to reveal what software is being cracked in each post since I don't want to hurt small or boutique software developers. 

These posts are just meant to highlight some techniques I use and to teach people how to bypass software restrictions. It's up to you to decide when cracking is ethical.

That being said, I may inadvertently reveal which piece of software is featured and for the reason described above, I'd ask you not to use the information from the article to crack said software.

Or more accurately, you can crack it, but just pay the developers too.
